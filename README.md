Notes+
Notes+ is a web-based note-taking application developed as part of the NeoFlux Front-end Internship program. The project serves as a practical learning experience to train and test the skills and knowledge of interns in front-end development, using modern technologies and tools.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a fully functional notes application where users can create, edit, delete, and manage journal entries. The project introduces key concepts such as state management, theme switching (light/dark mode), and the use of modern front-end technologies.

Features
Create and Manage Journals: Users can create new journal entries, view saved entries, and edit or delete existing ones.
Rich Text Formatting: Supports rich text formatting through a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor using the Jodit-Editor library.
Light/Dark Theme: The application includes a theme toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark modes.
State Management: Implemented using Redux for managing global states like theme selection, editor content, and journal data.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific notes by title or content.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.

Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JS: Core technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity.
React JS: Used for building the UI with reusable components, making the code more organized.
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript handling requests and responses.
Vite: Development tool for quick React setup and hot-reloading.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling directly in JSX.
Figma: Used to design and prototype the appâ€™s layout before coding.
React Redux: Manages the global state of the app, making data tracking easier across components.
Git/GitHub: Version control for tracking changes and sharing code.
Express JS: Node.js framework for creating back-end routes and handling API requests.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and journal entries.
pnpm: Fast package manager for efficient library and tool management.
VS Code: Code editor with customizable extensions for efficient coding.
Jodit-Editor: WYSIWYG editor for formatting journal content.
